# Agent Starter Kit

> Speak naturally. A Maestro agent breaks your request into tasks and routes each one to a specialized AI model.

The scaffold for a fully customizable, **multi-model** AI harness in **pure natural language**. The smartest model orchestrates the workflow while cheaper/faster ones handle the less complicated bits, **extending your premium coding plan (such as Claude Code)**.

It's model-agnostic: orchestrate from Claude, plan on GLM, review on Qwen, or any combination you want.

*Maestro booted on a Clean Architecture Go project — gitignore, auto-update, memory, rules, and 35 context files created automatically.*

This is a **foundation**, not a finished product. It ships only what an average developer needs out of the box — general-purpose personas, common workflow skills, and unopinionated rules. Anything domain-specific or highly opinionated belongs in your own fork. Clone it, extend it, make it yours — or better yet, make one for your entire company to use.

## Setup

1. Clone into `.agents/` inside your project:

   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/project
   git clone git@github.com:ntorga/agent-starter-kit.git .agents
   ```

2. Symlink the entry file to the project root:

   ```bash
   ln -s .agents/AGENTS.md AGENTS.md
   ```

3. Start the AI agent (e.g., `claude`, or whatever CLI you use).
4. Say **"Please comply with AGENTS.md."** — this boots the Maestro and loads the framework.
5. The Maestro orchestrates everything. On first run, it automatically dispatches the Contextualizer to map the codebase.
6. Customize — add personas, rules, skills, and providers to fit your project (see Customization below).

## How It Works

The **Maestro** is the conductor. It receives user requests, decomposes them, and dispatches work to specialized personas:

- **Architect** — plans implementations, defines before/after states
- **Coder** — writes software following the plan
- **Reviewer** — checks work for correctness and quality
- **Contextualizer** — documents project structure for orientation

Each persona has an identity (who they are), a playbook (what they do), a handoff format (what they deliver), and red lines (what they must not do). Each persona also declares a `preferredModel` — the Maestro uses this to route work to the right provider automatically.

The framework **learns as it works**. Corrections, preferences, and lessons are captured to long-term memory and carried into every future session. Interrupted work is tracked in session files so the next boot can resume where the last one stopped.

## Structure

```
personas/    Specialized AI roles (who does the work)
rules/       Constraints organized by authority level
skills/      Reusable procedures and protocols
```

## Rules Hierarchy

- **Commandments** — absolute, never bypassed
- **Edicts** — authoritative within scope, not bent
- **Counsel** — wise guidance, may be deviated from with justification

## Skills

Skills codify procedures that personas reference. They answer "how to do X" so personas can focus on "what to do."

- **agent-memory** — long-term and session memory across sessions
- **boot** — session startup sequence
- **code-coherence-review** — logic coherence, correctness, and structural integrity checks
- **code-quality-review** — rules-walk procedure for coding standards compliance
- **code-sec-review** — OWASP-aligned security code review checklist
- **context-maintenance** — schema and rules for `.context.md` files
- **dispatch** — how the Maestro assembles and sends work to personas
- **loop-recovery** — structured recovery and escalation for retry loops
- **task-tracking** — file-based to-do for multi-step work

## Customization

- **Dispatch** — edit `skills/dispatch.md` to match your CLI agents. The Providers table and CLI Dispatch section are pre-configured for Claude Code and [opencode](https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode) (Qwen). Add rows for any other provider/model you use.
- Add new personas to `personas/` following the schema in `personas/README.md`
- Add rules to `rules/commandments/`, `rules/edicts/`, or `rules/counsel/`
- Add skills to `skills/` following the schema in `skills/README.md`
- Modify existing files to match your project's needs

Each directory has a README with the full schema definition.

## FAQ

### Why this over other harnesses?

Frameworks like GSD, HumanLayer, and OpenDev are software — they require a programming language, dependencies, and runtime integration. This kit is **pure natural language**. Every persona, rule, and skill is a Markdown file. There is no code to install, no SDK to learn, no build step to maintain.

Other harnesses are bulldozers — heavy with built-in packages, skills, and guidance that consume tokens every session, even when most of it is irrelevant to your project. This kit is a **scalpel**: minimal by design, meant to be extended with your own tailored personas, rules, and skills. You pay only for the context you actually need. Add a persona by writing a `.md` file. Change a rule by editing a line. Swap a provider by updating a table row.

### Why multi-model?

Coding plans are routinely quantized and rate-limited weeks after launch — the version you fell in love with gradually loses sharpness as the provider optimizes for throughput. A multi-model harness fights this in three ways:

1. **Resilience.** Spreading work across providers means you're less affected when any single plan degrades. If one provider tightens limits or loses quality, shift that persona's `preferredModel` to another row in the Providers table.
2. **Token conservation.** The orchestrator (Maestro) only handles routing and decomposition. Token-heavy roles like Architect and Coder are delegated to other capable models, so your premium plan lasts longer.
3. **Fresh eyes.** Different models catch different things. A reviewer running on a separate provider will flag issues that the coder's model normalized.

### What do I need to run this?

A coding plan or API key for each provider you route to. We recommend coding plans — **Claude Code** (Anthropic), **Codex** (OpenAI), and **Alibaba Model Studio** (Qwen) offer flat-rate pricing with generous token allowances designed for agentic workflows. API keys work too, but plans are more cost-effective for sustained use. Each provider needs its CLI tool installed (e.g., `claude` for Claude Code, `opencode` for Qwen). If you only route to one provider, one plan is enough.

### How does the Maestro use multiple models from a single CLI?

The dispatch skill (`skills/dispatch.md`) handles this automatically. When a persona's `preferredModel` matches the host runtime (e.g., you're running Claude Code and the persona wants `claude`), the Maestro dispatches natively using the host's built-in subagent mechanism (e.g., the Task tool). When the `preferredModel` points to a different provider (e.g., `qwen`), the Maestro shells out to that provider's CLI tool (e.g., `opencode`) by piping the assembled prompt via `stdin`. The Providers table in `skills/dispatch.md` maps each model to its CLI — add rows for any provider you want to use.

### Can I use this with just one model?

Yes. Set every persona's `preferredModel` to your host runtime (e.g., `claude`) and the framework runs entirely within a single provider. You still benefit from the structured decomposition, review pipeline, and long-term memory — just without the multi-model routing.

### How should I assign models to personas?

Each persona declares a `preferredModel` in its frontmatter — this is what the Maestro uses to route work. Keep premium models as the orchestrator (Maestro makes routing decisions and manages context — short, high-leverage interactions worth the cost). For the rest, match the model to the persona's job using role-specific benchmarks:

- **Coder** — [LiveCodeBench](https://artificialanalysis.ai/evaluations/livecodebench) (real-world coding tasks)
- **Architect** — [Artificial Analysis Long Context Reasoning](https://artificialanalysis.ai/evaluations/artificial-analysis-long-context-reasoning) (multi-step reasoning across large contexts)
- **Reviewer** — [IFBench](https://artificialanalysis.ai/evaluations/ifbench) (instruction following and constraint verification)

These benchmarks are examples — new ones emerge frequently. Pick whatever benchmark best measures the capability each role needs, then set `preferredModel` accordingly in the persona's frontmatter.

### Does the framework auto-update?

Yes. On every session start, the boot sequence runs `git -C .agents pull`. If the pull brings changes, the Maestro reads the changelog, purges any long-term memory entries that the update made obsolete, and reboots with the new instructions.

### What does "model-agnostic" mean? Which models are supported?

Any model with a CLI tool that can accept a prompt via `stdin` works. As a quality floor, we recommend models scoring 1300+ ELO on [GDPval-AA](https://artificialanalysis.ai/evaluations/gdpval-aa) — a benchmark for general-purpose reasoning. Below that threshold, personas may struggle with multi-step tasks.
